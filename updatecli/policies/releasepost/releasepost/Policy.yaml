  releasepost is a release note town crier.
  It retrieves release notes from a third location, like a GitHub release,
  and then copy them locally to your directory of choice.
  This policy takes care of publishing any new file generated to a git repository.
  It creates one file per release note version and an index file.
  It can creates files using different formats like markdown, asciidoctor, or json.
